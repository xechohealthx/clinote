Clinote Whisper Server - Quick Install for macOS
================================================

If you get a security warning, use these commands instead:

1. Open Terminal (Applications → Utilities → Terminal)

2. Copy and paste these commands one by one:

cd ~/Downloads
curl -O https://github.com/xechohealthx/clinote/releases/latest/download/Clinote-Whisper-Installer.command
chmod +x Clinote-Whisper-Installer.command
./Clinote-Whisper-Installer.command

That's it! The installer will run automatically.

If you still get security warnings, try:
sudo spctl --master-disable
(Then run the commands above)

To re-enable security after installation:
sudo spctl --master-enable
